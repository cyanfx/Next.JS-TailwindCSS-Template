## Barebone configs for a NextJS/TailwindCSS project (No TypeScript)

ESLint and Prettier are also minimally setup.

**If you're using VSCode, the following plugins are recommended:**

- ESLint
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- PostCSS Language Support (Fix errors in global.css with TailwindCSS)
- Tailwind CSS Intellisense
- Prettier (Set this as the default formatter. Format on save is also recommended.)
